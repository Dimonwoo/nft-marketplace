    <p class="p8 ft7"><span class="ft4">7.1</span><span class="ft5">In this Section 7, we have summarised the rights that you have under data protection law. Some of the rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights.</span></p>
    <p class="p31 ft9"><span class="ft4">7.2</span><span class="ft8">Your principal rights under data protection law are:</span></p>
    <p class="p12 ft9"><span class="ft4">(a)</span><span class="ft10">the right to access;</span></p>
    <p class="p11 ft9"><span class="ft4">(b)</span><span class="ft10">the right to rectification;</span></p>
    <p class="p12 ft9"><span class="ft4">(c)</span><span class="ft11">the right to erasure;</span></p>
    <p class="p12 ft9"><span class="ft4">(d)</span><span class="ft10">the right to restrict processing;</span></p>
    <p class="p12 ft9"><span class="ft4">(e)</span><span class="ft10">the right to object to processing;</span></p>
    <p class="p12 ft9"><span class="ft4">(f)</span><span class="ft18">the right to data portability;</span></p>
    <p class="p32 ft9"><span class="ft4">(g)</span><span class="ft11">the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and</span></p>
    <p class="p12 ft9"><span class="ft4">(h)</span><span class="ft10">the right to withdraw consent.</span></p>
    <p class="p7 ft7"><span class="ft4">7.3</span><span class="ft5">You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where we do, access to the personal data, together with certain additional information. That additional information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data, as described below (clause 7.13).</span></p>
    <p class="p6 ft7"><span class="ft4">7.4</span><span class="ft5">You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.</span></p>

    <div id="id5_1">
    <p class="p14 ft15"><span class="ft4">7.5</span><span class="ft13">In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue delay. Those circumstances include: the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to </span><nobr>consent-based</nobr> processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions include where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>
    <p class="p33 ft15"><span class="ft4">7.6</span><span class="ft13">In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.</span></p>
    <p class="p34 ft4"><span class="ft4">7.7</span><span class="ft17">You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</span></p>
    <p class="p35 ft7"><span class="ft4">7.8</span><span class="ft5">You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to process your personal data for this purpose.</span></p>
    <p class="p4 ft7"><span class="ft4">7.9</span><span class="ft5">You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.</span></p>
    <p class="p5 ft9"><span class="ft4">7.10</span><span class="ft19">To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is:</span></p>
    <p class="p32 ft9"><span class="ft4">(a)</span><span class="ft10">consent; or</span></p>
    <p class="p36 ft9"><span class="ft4">(b)</span><span class="ft10">that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract,</span></p>
    </div>
    <div id="id5_2">

    <div id="id6_1">
    <p class="p37 ft7">and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and <nobr>machine-readable</nobr> format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
    <p class="p3 ft7"><span class="ft4">7.11</span><span class="ft20">If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.</span></p>
    <p class="p9 ft7"><span class="ft4">7.12</span><span class="ft20">To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.</span></p>
    <p class="p3 ft7"><span class="ft4">7.13</span><span class="ft20">You may request that we provide you with any personal information we hold about you. Provision of this information will be subject to the supply of appropriate evidence of your identity (for this purpose, we will usually accept a photocopy of your passport certified by a solicitor or bank plus an original copy of a utility bill showing your current address).</span></p>
