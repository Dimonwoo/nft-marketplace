    <p class="p18 ft8">Users can use the 'Create a Relic' function on the platform to leave a photograph or other image at a certain geographic location for others to find. The user will also have the opportunity to attach BSV (Bitcoin) to their Relic. When a Relica user’s GPS matches the placement of the Relic location chosen by the user, the user will be notified that they have ‘found’ the Relic by a notification and an animated image of confetti will appear over the image which has been found.</p>
    <p class="p18 ft8">Relica may create also create Relics to be left in certain places for users to locate and benefit from. If the Photo has BSV – Bitcoin attached, the first finder of the Photo will receive that amount of Bitcoin into their private wallet.</p>
    <p class="p18 ft8">Full details on how to 'Create a Relic' function can be found on the platform. Should you have any questions about how to find a geo-located Relic, or any other questions, please get in touch with us at contact@Relica.world.</p>

    <p class="p20 ft0">Important points to note about Creating and Locating Geo-Located Relics</p>
    <p class="p18 ft8">Due to the nature of the 'Create a Relic' function, which requires a cellular data plan or GPS device and the ability to travel to geo-located locations, this service is not directed toward anyone under the age of 16. If you are under the age of 18 but at least 16, you may only use our services with the consent of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by this Agreement.</p>
    <p class="p18 ft8">Please be aware that searching for geo-located Relics can be dangerous if it takes you to difficult to access places, isolated places or other treacherous locations. Users should also be aware that some locations may be private property which the user has no legal right to enter.</p>
    <p class="p18 ft8">When seeking geo-located Relics, you must be aware of the risk to your property, including the possibility of bodily injury, or even death. Variables you must consider include: the weather, your fitness level, the terrain features, and whether you are alone or with other. Always exercise common sense and caution.</p>

    <p class="p11 ft13"><span class="ft11">•</span><span class="ft12">We receive any complaint from the owner or occupier of any land adjacent to or on which the Relic is located.</span></p>
    <p class="p11 ft13"><span class="ft11">•</span><span class="ft12">We have a reasonable belief that the user who posted the Relic is no longer active on the Platform.</span></p>
    <p class="p11 ft13"><span class="ft11">•</span><span class="ft12">We believe the removal of the Relic is in the best interest of the Relica community.</span></p>
    <p class="p20 ft0">Safety</p>
